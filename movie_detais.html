    NTSC composite video signal (analog)
    Video was invented decades after film, which records a sequence of miniature images visible to the eye when the film is physically examined. Video, by contrast, encodes images with electromagnetic waves.[3]
    
    Video technology was first developed for mechanical television systems, which were quickly replaced by cathode-ray tube (CRT) television systems. Video was originally exclusively live technology. Charles Ginsburg led an Ampex research team to develop one of the first practical video tape recorders (VTR). In 1951, the first VTR captured live images from television cameras by writing the camera's electrical signal onto magnetic videotape.</p>
